# CFSAN Wastewater Analysis Pipeline

## **Given the [project timeline](https://www.fda.gov/food/whole-genome-sequencing-wgs-program/wastewater-surveillance-sars-cov-2-variants), C-WAP will no longer be under active  development or maintenance come June 30, 2023. [Freyja](https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja) or [Kallisto](https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto) (two of the tools C-WAP incorporates) may be of interest.  Thank you for joining us on our analytic journey.**

C-WAP is a Nextflow, Python, and bash-based bioinformatics pipeline for the analysis of either long-read (ONT or PacBio) or short-read (Illumina) whole genome sequencing
data of DNA extracted from wastewater. It was developed for SARS-CoV2 and its variants.

C-WAP was developed by the United States Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.


### Introduction

The CFSAN Wastewater Analysis Pipeline uses a reference-based alignment to create a matrix of
SNPs for a given set of samples and estimate the percentage of SC2 variants in the sample 

The process includes the following:
1. Designating a reference and NGS data in fastq format
2. Alignment of reads to the reference via Bowtie2
3. Taxonomy check via Kraken2
4. Processing of alignment results via Samtools
5. Detection of variant positions with iVar
6. Determine composition of variants via Kallisto, Linear Regression, Kraken2/Bracken and Freyja
7. Generate an HTML and PDF formatted summary of results

`./startWorkflow.nf` assumes that Conda, Micromamba, Nextflow and gs executables are available in the search path. All other dependencies are imported via Conda, with the exception of Freyja, which is imported via Micromamba. To trigger this installation, execute `c-wap/prepare_envs.sh` (no root privileges needed). The series of acquisition of the dependencies and creating of the env's might take a substantially long time (potentially hours). Subsequent analysis calls to C-WAP will make use of the cached env's stored under the c-wap/conda subdirectory and are expected to finish substantially faster. To update the dependencies (more often required for tools with a biological DB) delete the respective environement folder `c-wap/conda/env-<toolName>` and re-execute `c-wap/prepare_envs.sh`.


### Installation

Install Nextflow, Conda, and Micromamba. Afterwards, download c-wap repository and save. In addition, also obtain a copy of the Kraken2 standard DB (~50GB). You can either download a copy from here: https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2 or you can compile your own version following the instructions under the "Standard Kraken2 Database" section here: https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.markdown

Afterwards, set `$K2_STD_DB_PATH` to your download location.


### Usage 

The driver script is `startWorkflow.nf` and a standard execution with paired end illumina reads would be:  
`startWorkflow.nf --platform i --primers path/to/bed --in path/to/fastq/ --out path/to/outputDir`

Note that the input files need to be compressed fastq.gz formats only and .sam, .bam or uncompressed .fastq files result in a fatal runtime error.


### Output

C-WAP produces a number of files from the various processing steps.  

`report` - Standalone directory containing html and pdf summary report  
`absCounts.csv` - Absolute counts table of uncovered and undercovered genes  
`breadthVcov.csv` - Table of coverage depth and breadth  
`consensus.fa` - Consensus fasta file generated by iVar  
`crdSNPs.csv` - Table of common, rare, and diverse SNP coverages  
`freyja.demix` - Lineage abundance estimate generated by Freyja  
`freyja_boot_lineages.csv` - Freyja generated bootstraps  
`k2-majorCovid.out` - Covid-specific kraken2 output with major lineages identified, against majorCovid DB  
`k2-majorCovid_bracken.out` - Bracken lineage abundance estimates, against majorCovid DB  
`k2-std.out` - Kraken2 output with standard database  
`kallisto.out` - Python-parsed summary of the kallisto lineage abundance estimates  
`kallisto_abundance.tsv` - Kallisto estimates of variant composition  
`lineage_report.csv` - Pangolin lineage prediction for the consensus sequence  
`linearDeconvolution_abundance.csv` - Linear deconvolution estimates of variant composition  
`mutationTable.csv` - Lineage defining mutations  
`pos-coverage-quality.tsv` - QC metrics on coverage and quality obtained from the pileup file  
`primer_hit_counts.tsv` - Number of reads per primer  
`qc-flags` - Suggested QC flags  
`resorted.stats` - Samtools stats output from aligned and trimmed reads  
`scaledCounts.csv` - Scaled counts table of uncovered and undercovered genes  
`seqSummary.csv` - Average read quality, length, and coverage passing filter  
`sorted.stats` - Samtools stats output from aligned but untrimmed reads  


### Note about variant composition

Variant composition analyses should be interpreted with caution where they should be treated as suspect if there are substantial gaps in coverage across the reference genome and/or a lack of sequencing depth.  The linear deconvolution and kraken2/bracken covid method are internally developed methods and under testing and validation.
